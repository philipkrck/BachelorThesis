\section{Feature Selection} \label{section::feature_selection}
- What are the necessary features that were selected and why?

\section{Performance Comparison} \label{section::performance_comparison_design}
- find measurement units (CPU, GPU, memory, etc.)\\
- why are the measurement units relevant?\\
- think of individual click journeys which will be measured that make use of the features mentioned in section above\\
- try to find a capture-replay\\
- Vorgehen zur Messung / Erhebung\\
- repeat measurements multiple times (accuracy)\\
- calculate statistical figures between measurements (variance)\\
- find appropriate tooling for measurements\\


\section{User Experience Comparison}
- structured expert interview\\
- goal is to get input on subjective user experience\\
