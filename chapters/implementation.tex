\chapter{Application Design and Implementation} \label{section::implementation}
- what is the exact Flutter version that I've been using?

\section{Kickdown Feature Presentation}
Here I will present what the original features of the Kickdown app are


-> think of use specific instances where it is interesting to detail the implementation of the Flutter app 
    - image gallery

\section{Flutter Implementation}

- Thesis is not an [Ingenieurswissenschaftliche Arbeit] and thus application design and implementation will be explained from a perspective
a necessary requirement to execute both the performance and UX comparison.
- goal from development perspective was to get implement Flutter as close as possible to the original app in terms of UI
- used as many out of the box cupertino widgets as possible for implementation
- only deviated from above guideline when absolutely necessary
- this was the case when implementing the following features
- image gallery (zooming ability), image caching, custom modal iOS 13 presentation)s
- Naturally, software implementation complexity may impede performance if unscalable algorithms or memory-inefficient datastructures are chosen.
In order to prevent this bias to be introduced into the experiment, the Flutter app was implemented as closely as possible to the original iOS app. Todo: explain in what way.

- should I explain the general app architecture which was used?(MVVM + Services)
