\chapter{Application Design and Implementation}
- Implementation of app is necessary for both performance and UX comparison\\
- goal from development perspective was to get implement Flutter as close as possible to the original app in terms of UI\\
- used as many out of the box cupertino widgets as possible for implementation\\
- only deviated from above guideline when absolutely necessary\\
- this was the case when implementing the following features\\
- image gallery (zooming ability), image caching, custom modal iOS 13 presentation)\\s

- should I explain the general app architecture which was used?(MVVM + Services)\\
