\chapter{Performance Comparison}
- Use mean as measurement of tests for comparison purposes
- Use multiple devices?
- also measure startup time after initial download
- CPU, idle-state RAM occupancy (PreRAM), busy-state memory occupancy (RAM), ComputedRAM
- explain Xcode profiling tools
- explain what the individual benchmarks actually mean
- do benchmarking on multiple devices to be representative for all iOS devices -> find num of iOS devices which support currentIOS-1
- How is the device prepared before taking a measurement?
- mean, min, max, std deviation
- perform Anova or Tukey post-hoc test to determine statistical significance b/w both groups
- visualize data using R to examine it properly (boxplot, etc.)
- The performance analysis is conducted by comparing X tests for each performance metric, on both the Flutter and iOS app
- TODO: Explain which tools etc. were used for comparison (Xcode Tools + Flutter Profiling)
- look at specific actions within app (like scrolling, opening page) for comparison
- use "Instruments" from Xcode
- read Springer paper to explain potential performance differences
-> Time profiler tool for CPU usage
-> Core Animation tool for GPU FPS
-> Allocations tool for memory usage
