On Android the performance would be expected to be even more similar or even better since apple is a company that controls the entire hardware software stack and is known for optimizing performance through this control.
Therefore, on Android where the hardware manufacturer doesn't control the OS, the performance of Flutter may be even better when compared to iOS.
